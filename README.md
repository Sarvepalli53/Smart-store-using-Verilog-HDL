# Smart-store-using-Verilog-HDL
The smart store project enables a hassle free and faster shopping, caters to the safety of the customers and even contributes in reducing the carbon foot print. It aims at providing a more comfortable and enjoyable shopping experience. This is mainly beneficial to the customers who procure less commodities and are in a hurry to leave.
The project implements the feature smart trolley, automated lights, door and fire alarm and a system to count and display the number of customers present in a billing line. The description of each of the feature is given in the report. The verilog codes for the schematic and simulation of each of the features are - 
Smart trolley schematic in add_product.v and simulation in test.v.
 Automated door schematic in door_open.v and simulation in door_test.v.
 Automated lights schematic in automated_lights.v and simulation in test_lights.v.
 Automated fire alarm schematic in alaram.v and simulation in fire_alarm_test.v.
 customer counting system schematic in counter1.v and simulation in tb.v.
